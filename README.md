# PicMemo  

PicMemo is a SwiftUI app that allows users to capture and save memories with photos, descriptions, and location data.  

## Features  
- **Photo Selection:** Pick images using UIKit’s `PHPickerViewController`.  
- **Add Descriptions:** Provide a custom description for each photo.  
- **Location Tagging:** Automatically associate the current location with each photo displaying it with MapKit.  
- **Data Storage:** Store memos securely and efficiently with SwiftUI’s state management.  

## Highlights  
- Integrates UIKit components like `PHPickerViewController` into a SwiftUI-based app.  
- Uses **MapKit** to display and tag user locations.  
- Demonstrates key concepts such as `@StateObject` and `@ObservedObject` for data sharing and management.  

## Acknowledgments  
This project idea was originally proposed as part of the 100 Days of SwiftUI course by [Paul Hudson](https://github.com/twostraws). The solution implemented here reflects my personal approach, design decisions, and coding style.

**Note:** This project is a sample app created for learning purposes and exploring the integration of UIKit and SwiftUI.
